# What are timesheets?

Timesheets are a concept unique the payroll industry, so you may not be familiar with them. Here's some basic explanations so you can navigate through features better.

## What is a timesheet?

A timesheet is a document that tells a person how much each employee is being paid. In most systems, a timesheet (*also known as a Payroll*) is a **table** that features a row for each employee with the following columns:

- The employee's name

- Their Pay Type

- Their Pay Rate

- If their Pay Type is unit-based, the number of units

- Their gross wages

Additionally, a timesheet offers information about the payroll. For example: Pay Period, and Check Date

## What is a Pay Period

A Pay Period is the date range that an employee is being compensated for. Most pay periods are 7 or 14 days long.

## What is a Check

A "Check" is a term used for the single payment made to an employee for the work they've done during a Pay Period. The amount of money is also called "Gross Wages".

## What is the Check Date

A Check Date is the calendar date when a payment is issued to an employee for work done during a Pay Period.

## What is a Pay Type

An employee can be paid in different arrangements. Most people are paid one of two ways: Hourly or Salary.

Hourly employees have a fixed rate they are paid for each hour they work. This is most common in industries where demand can change, like restaurants. This means their total pay

Salary employees have a fixed amount of money they are paid for every pay period. This is most common for full-time employees and office workers.

## What is a Pay Rate

A Pay Rate is the amount of money an employer offers to an employee based on their Pay Type.

Pay Rates can be unit-based, like for Hourly employees. This means their Gross Wages differ on each check. If they work less hours during a pay period, they are paid less, and vice-versa.

A Pay Rate can also be fixed, like for Salary employees. This is a more stable form of pay, where working less does not affect the employee's gross wages for a pay period.

## What is a Gross Payroll

The "Gross Payroll" usually refers to the combined Gross Wages of all employees during a payroll.

## Example

You can imagine a timesheet that looks like this:

| Check Date: 02/09/2023 | Pay Period: 01/27/2024 - 02/02/2024 |

| Employee | Pay Type | Pay Rate      | Hours   | Gross Wages |
|----------|----------|---------------|---------|-------------|
| John     | Hourly   | $12.00        | 20      | $240.00     |
| Bob      | Salary   | $480.00       | -       | $480.00     |
|          |          |               |         |             |
|          |          | Gross Payroll | $720.00 |
